ðŸŽ¯ Problem: Maximize Points Over Consecutive Days
Given:

A list of days, and for each day, 3 activities.

Each activity gives a certain number of points.

You can't do the same activity on two consecutive days.

Goal: Choose one activity per day to maximize your total score, with the constraint that no activity is repeated on consecutive days.
